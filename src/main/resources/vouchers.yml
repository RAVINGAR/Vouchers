# Define the MATERIAL id of an item/block here. The specified material will mean that a player must have unlocked the specified
# voucher for this material in order to craft it, place it, use it, or anything else. Adding items here will prevent using
# them, adding armour will prevent equipping them, adding consumables will prevent them from being consumed, adding blocks
# will prevent them from being placed and broken (if configured) ONLY if the item is a vanilla type. (As custom item
# types from other plugins are currently not supported)
#
# There are three types of possible items here
# Vanilla Minecraft - 'vanilla:<namespace>:<tier>'
# MMOItems - 'mmoitems:<type>:<identifier>:<tier>'
# Mythic Crucible - 'crucible:<identifier>:<tier>'
#
# If no namespace is specified then vanilla is assumed.
# A tier can quite literally be anything as the plugin will simply add whatever is specified here as a tier
# But for your purposes, you probably want to stick to "basic", "advanced" and "expert"
material-vouchers:

  - "vanilla:leather_chestplate:basic"
  - "vanilla:obsidian:advanced"

  # Farm vouchers must be considered different since they involve multiple materials. Added options here in cases
  # new farm items are added in the future. Minecraft is a bit weird regarding these materials, since sometimes the block id
  # material different to the item material, or the seed material is different or the same to the item material.
  # See https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html for a list of materials!
